Lua-Aided Design


## WHY!?!?!
Yeah i know there are already quite a few CAD options out there... but i have my own opinions about how to communicate a spatial object in code and they are:

- **Lua** is a great language for non-programmers.
  - It can be used without understanding computer science: for example numbers are doubles because teaching someone what numeric types are (and how or when to cast them) is only cool when they are interested.
  - It is small both in a computational and storage sense but also the whole language can be known by a single person in a reasonable amount of time.
- **Circles are not real**
  - I promise im not a crazy person, but in my mind a circle is just all locations a point can be from another.  Pi is rational the second you constrain your points to a grid.
- **APIs are their own language**
  - They are how we are going to agree to say what we are trying to communicate.
  - A good one has simple rules with nearly zero exceptions
  - A really good one will try to help the user understand what they are trying to say.
 - **Version Control features are a must for a community project**
 - **CAM and Slicers need to start having contextual information in the loop**
 - CAD could be (relatively) headless
